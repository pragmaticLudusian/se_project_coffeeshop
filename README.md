# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

_Somewhere, in the town of Triple Peaks, there is a library that nurtures success not only in the hard skills for the coding-inclined, but also in the soft skills to further one's social achievements beyond just the code._

_But what is a library without a place to relax and wind down after a hard day's work, taking that well-deserved pomodoro break time, or even just to hang out?_

_This is where I step in. ~Cyberbarista Andy_
